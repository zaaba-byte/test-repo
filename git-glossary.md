# Git Glossary

A running collection of important Git terms and their meanings.  
This file will grow as I learn and practice Git.

---

## HEAD
- A reference that points to the current commit in the checked-out branch.  
- Think of it as “where you are” in the repo’s history.  
- Usually points to the latest commit of the current branch.

---

## Branch
- A movable pointer to a commit.  
- Represents an independent line of development.  
- The default branch is often `main`.  
- Branches allow you to work on features or fixes without disturbing the main code.

---

## Commit
- A snapshot of the repository at a point in time.  
- Contains changes, a unique ID (SHA hash), author info, and a message.  
- Commits form the history of the project.

---

## Remote
- A version of your repository that is hosted elsewhere (e.g., GitHub).  
- Acts like a shared reference so others can collaborate.  
- Common remote name: `origin`.  
- You `push` to send changes to it and `pull`/`fetch` to bring changes from it.
